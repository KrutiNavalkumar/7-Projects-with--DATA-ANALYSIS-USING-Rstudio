# Gplaystore App Success Prediction - Data Analysis Using RStudio

## Project Overview

This project aims to predict the success of Google Play Store apps using data analysis techniques in RStudio. The analysis focuses on identifying key factors that influence an app's success and provides actionable insights for developers.

## Key Features

- **Data Collection**: Gathered data from the Google Play Store.
- **Data Cleaning**: Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Conducted EDA to uncover patterns and trends in the data.
- **Modeling**: Built predictive models to forecast app success.
- **Evaluation**: Assessed model performance and identified significant predictors of success.

## Files

- `data_collection.R`: Script for collecting data from the Google Play Store.
- `data_cleaning.R`: Script for cleaning and preprocessing the dataset.
- `eda.Rmd`: RMarkdown file for exploratory data analysis and visualization.
- `modeling.R`: Script for building and evaluating predictive models.
- `results.Rmd`: RMarkdown file for presenting the results and insights from the analysis.

## Data

The dataset includes various attributes of Google Play Store apps, such as category, rating, reviews, size, and installs, which are used to predict app success.

## Installation

To run the scripts and RMarkdown files, you need to have R and the required packages installed. You can install the necessary packages using the following command in R:

```r
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "caret", "randomForest"))
